            <p>Oct. 2017 - Mar. 2019</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use C++ to implement the objective evaluation methods of enhanced audio, such as SNR, fwSNR, LLR, WSS, PESQ to measure the performance of noise reduction algorithm.</li>
                <li>Automate data analysis, hypothesis test and data visualization to evaluate the advantage and the disadvantage of the noise reduction algorithm on different noise type and give a suggestion for future improvement.</li>
                <li>Tune and optimize the Noise Reduction Algorithm to balance the trade off between speech distorsion and noise reduction.</li>
                <li>Research and solve the correlation problem in Adaptive Acoustic Feedback Cancellation Algorithm, which can not suppress a continuous same-pitch sine tone. </li>

            <h3>Machine Learning Engineer - UnlimiterHear Co, Ltd</h3>
            <p>Mar. 2019 - May. 2020</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Develop a deep learning-based noise reduction approach to remove the non-stationary noise in a noisy audio, which can not be tackled by the traditional noise reduction algorithm.</li>
                <li>Develop data preparation pipelines with Python including audio augmentation, which mixes noise and speech with different Signal-to-Noise ratio and volume, and feature engineering, which transfer audio from time domain to frequency, Cepstrum, and Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) domain.</li>
                <li>Research and implement various types of models with Tensorflow/Keras, such as DNN, RNN, LSTM, CNN, U-net with different data input length, output length, loss function and hyperparameter.</li>
                <li>Develop a deep learning-based Voice Activity Detector (VAD) for singing songs, which solve the problem that traditional VAD can not distinguish instruments and vocals.</li>
                <li>Implement the method of Mobile-net on deep learning-based VAD, which reduce the parameters to 6%, while the accuracy only dropped by 3%, to enable the deep learning model to operate on the PC in real time.</li>
                <li>Demonstrate the deep learning-based VAD model with an animation drawed by Pygame to the clients.</li>
